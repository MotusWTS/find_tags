	* find_tags_motus.cpp: call Tag_Database::load_ambiguity() to restore
	Ambiguity map from database; could instead add Tag_Database * to
	c'tor for DB_Filer

	* Ambiguity.hpp, Ambiguity.cpp: extend newProxy to allow specifying
	the proxyID, as when reconstructing a group from the database; make
	this method public so DB_Filer class can do that.

	* Tag_Foray.cpp (pause, resume): don't serialize/deserialize
	Ambiguity map as part of batch pause/resume; instead, maintain a
	global tagAmbig table in receiver DB

	* Tag_Database.hpp, Tag_Database.cpp: include getTagForMotusID in
	RELEASE build for use by DB_Filer::load_ambig

	* DB_Filer.hpp, DB_Filer.cpp: replace previous Ambiguity-related
	methods with new methods save_ambiguity() to save a single ambiguity group
	and load_ambiguity() to restore all existing ambiguities from the database
