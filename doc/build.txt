In order to build the find_tags module of motus, you need to have a C++ compiler and the boost libraries.
If you are using a Debian based Linux distribution, you can use the following command to install the required parts

   sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev g++ libsqlite3-dev

You can now make the Linux version with the following commands from within the repository directory:

   cd src
   make find_tags_motus
