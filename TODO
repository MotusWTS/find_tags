- 2016-05: DONE: allow more flexible run structure:  currently, a tag run must begin
  with a pair of consecutive bursts, because of the 'sanity check'
  in Tag_Finder.cpp::setup_graph().  But why can't we just allow that
  some sequences of consecutive bursts are ambiguous, and use the
  tagID level to determine when a candidate is finally confirmed?

- 2016-05: DONE: allow adding and removing a single tag to the graph, so that the
  list of tags being sought can change over time

- allow for missing pulses in a burst
