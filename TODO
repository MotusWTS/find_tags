Bursts are being put in multiple runs - why!?

The following code finds some tag records where the same burst
appears in multiple runs on the same antenna and receiver.  Why???

t=tags("tagProj=='Taylr' and sp=='COTE' and site=='CTRYI' and id==480
   and ant=='1 '")
tt=subset(t, id==480 & ts >= ymd_hms("2013-06-27 19:23:06") & ts <= ymd_hms("2013-06-27 19:39:43"))

This was also true in the previous version of the merged database.

Looking at country island's alltags.rds, there are 1596 duplicated
records out of 1.5 million records (ignoring the runID, posInRun,
burstslop fields)

  x=readRDS("2013_taylor_country_island_alltags.rds")
  sum(duplicated(x[,-c(9, 10, 12)]))


Is this a bug in the tagfinder, or was this due to the faulty RAM, or
something else?  
Re ran tagfinder today (Mar 31, 2014) and got identical results, so
there's something wonky in the tag finder.
